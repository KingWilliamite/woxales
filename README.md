# My Personal Website

A barebones, fast, and simple personal website built using only HTML and CSS. This project serves as a public display of my existence. 

## 🚀 Overview

This website is a **static site**, meaning it has no backend, database, or dynamic scripting. All content is pre-rendered in HTML, and all presentation is handled by a single CSS file.

## 📁 Project Structure

The project uses a flat, simple structure for maximum clarity and easy deployment.

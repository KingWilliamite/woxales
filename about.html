                <h2>On Building Brands</h2>
                <p>Building a brand is not just about creating a logo and a website. Nor is it about the financial opportunities it brings. Your goal as a founder is to focus on a vision mission so grandiose it outlasts your lifetime. You want to build a brand that is not just a company, but a movement. A movement that is so powerful it transcends generations. A movement that is so powerful it changes the world forever. </p>

                <h2>On Dinosaurs</h2>
                <p>Dinosaurs are not just animals. They are a symbol of the past, the present, and the future. They are a reminder that we are not alone in this universe. They are a reminder that we are all part of the same journey. They are a reminder that we are all part of the same story. </p>

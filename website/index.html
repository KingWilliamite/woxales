            <h1>Hi, I'm Will.</h1>
            <p class="intro-text">I'm an obsessive-compulsive overachiever. I share my thoughts, document my projects, and curate helpful resources as if I was the brother you wish you had.</p>
            <p>As you explore, you'll find that I'm a lot like you. I'm not perfect, but I'm a lot like you. I was 18 years old halfway through grad year of highschool when covid hit. My world literally fell apart into a 180 degree turn. I had to learn to live with myself all over again. I was working at Walmart and it gave me a glimpse of a future I did not want. My <i>eyes opened</i> and I saw a society instilled on indoctrination and brainwashing. I saw the world for what it really is. <i>Producers vs Consumers.</i> My goal is to create a space where people can learn from my experiences and mistakes. I want to be a source of inspiration and motivation for others. OxyCorps is my way of doing that. When I build companies and invest in brands I follow three principles: <br> Integrity, Delusion, and Faith. <br> </p>
            <p>Currently I am building WooMe which is a Proactive Journal for Mindfulness and Productivity.<br> As mentioned before, I founded OxyCorps which is a collection of companies and brands that I believe in. <br> I am also partered with a fresh startup which turns Sudoku into a 3D puzzle game. </p>
